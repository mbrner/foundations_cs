\question \textbf{Landau Symbols}

\begin{parts}
\part Order the class of functions in ascending order. (From slowest growing in time complexity
to fastest growing)

\[O(c_n^2), O(n), O(n^{c_1}), O(n^{c_2}), O(1), O(log n)\]

where \(c1\), \(c2\) are constants that satisfy \(0 < c1 < 1\) and \(1 < c2\).

\begin{solution}
Here goes the solution
\end{solution}
