\question \textbf{Matching - Warmup}

\begin{parts}

\part What is maximum matching?
\begin{solution}
    Matching of the maximum cardinality or A matching, PP, of graph, GG, is said to be maximal if no other edges of GG can be added to PP because every node is matched to another node. 
        
\end{solution}

\part Is Matching using a directed or undirected graph?
\begin{solution}
    Matching is using an undirectedgraph. 
\end{solution}

\part What is perfect matching?
\begin{solution}
    Every vertex V is matched.
\end{solution}

\part What is a bipartite graph?
\begin{solution}
A graph G = (V , E) is bipartite if there exist A, B $\subseteq$ V with A $\cup$ B = V , A $\cap$ B = $\emptyset$ and each edge in E has one end in A and one end in B
\end{solution}

\part Which pages of the \enquote{Algorithms 3rd.pdf} discusses matching?
\begin{solution}
985-1014
\end{solution}

\part What is the difference between \enquote{maximal matching} and \enquote{maximum matching}?
\begin{solution}
    A matching is a maximum matching if it is a matching that contains the largest possible number of edges matching as many nodes as possible
       
\end{solution}
