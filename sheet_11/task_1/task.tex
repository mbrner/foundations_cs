    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is maximum matching?
        Matching of the maximum cardinality or A matching, PP, of graph, GG, is said to be maximal if no other edges of GG can be added to PP because every node is matched to another node. 
        \item Is Matching using a directed or undirected graph?
        Matching is using an undirectedgraph. 
        \item What is perfect matching?
        Every vertex V is matched. 
        \item What is a bipartite graph?
        Bipartite graphs
        A graph G = (V , E) is bipartite if there exist A, B $\subseteq$ V with A $\cup$ B = V , A $\cap$ B = $\emptyset$ and each edge in E has one end in A and one end in B
        \item Which pages of the ‘Algorithms 3rd.pdf‘ discusses matching?
        985-1014
        \item What is the difference between ‘maximal matching‘ and ‘maximum matching‘?
        A matching is a maximum matching if it is a matching that contains the largest possible number of edges matching as many nodes as possible
