\question \textbf{Amortized Analysis I}
 Assume an array of a certain initial size $n$. After $n$ insertions the array is full and to insert more elements the array needs to be resized. One approach is to allocate a bigger array and to copy all previously inserted elements into the new array. The cost for insertion and copy of an element is $O(1)$ each.

\begin{parts}

\part How would you choose the size of the new array if you have to allocate additional space to achieve amortized linear runtime?


\begin{solution}
We would increase the size by a constant factor $c > 1$. 
\end{solution}


\part Use the accounting method to show that the amortized cost is indeed linear.


\begin{solution}
Let us assume $c=2$. This make the \textit{insert} operation cost $3$. 2 for inserting the value and moving it to a new array in the future. $+1$ for coyping a previous existing element into the new array. $\rightarrow$ 1 for the amortized cost of a \textit{resize} operation.
\end{solution}
