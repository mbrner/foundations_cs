\question \textbf{Amortized Analysis I}

Assume an array of a certain initial size \(n\). After \(n\) insertions the array is full and to insert more elements the array needs to be resized. One approach is to allocate a bigger array and to copy all previously inserted elements into the new array. The cost for insertion and copy of an element is \(O(1)\) each.

\begin{parts}
\part How would you choose the size of the new array if you have to allocate additional space to achieve amortized linear runtime?

\begin{solution}
Here goes the solution
\end{solution}


\part Use the accounting method to show that the amortized cost is indeed linear.

Here goes the solution
\end{solution}
