\question \textbf{Knapsack Problem}
Given the following instance of a Knapsack problem with 4 items with weight $w_i$ and value $v_i$. The knapsack capacity is 10. Model this problem as a graph problem to compute the subset of items with maximum total value fitting into the knapsack.

\begin{tabular}{c | c | c}
    $i$ & $w_i$ & $v_i$ \\
    \hline
    1 & 5 & 10 \\
    2 & 4 & 40 \\
    3 & 6 & 30 \\
    4 & 3 & 50
    \end{tabular}
