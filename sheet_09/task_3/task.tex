\question \textbf{Bellman-Ford}

Let $D = (V, A)$, $n = \left|V \right|$ be a directed graph. Prove that $D$ contains a circuit of negative length reachable from $s$ if and only if $f_n(v) \neq f_{nâˆ’1}(v)$, for some $v \in V$, where 

$$f_k(v) = \text{min}\left\{l(P)\middle|P \text{ is an } s \text{-} v \text{ walk traversing at most } k \text{ arcs}\right\}.$$


\begin{solution}

A => B 
Proof by contradiction

A and not B 

not B: $f_n(v)=f_n-1(v)$ 
This basically means, a longer way does not decrease the weight, hence all edges must have weights >= 0, which is a contradiction to A, that there is a negative cycle!

B=>A 
Proof by contradiction 

B and not A 
not A: D has no negatve cycle.

This means $f_n(v)$ < $f_n-1(v)$, so there must be a walk where there are more arc visited and the sum of all weights is smaller than before; hence there must be a negative cycle.
This is a contradiction to our assumption, that there is no negative cycle. 


\end{solution}
