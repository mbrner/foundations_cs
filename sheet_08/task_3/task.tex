\question \textbf{Hashing - Collision probabilties}

Given a hash table of size $m$ used to store $n \leq m/2$ items with open addressing collision resolution and assuming uniform hashing:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that for $i = 1, 2, \cdots , n$ the probability for the $i$-th insertion to require strictly more than $k$ probes is at most $2^{-k}$.
\item Show that for i = $i = 1, 2, \cdots , n$ the probability for the $i$-th insertion to require more than $2\log n$ probes is at most $O(1/n^2)$.
\end{enumerate}
